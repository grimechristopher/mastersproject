Abstract: In a business environment with strict competition among firms, accurate demand forecasting is not straightforward. In this paper, a forecasting method is proposed, which has a strong capability of predicting highly fluctuating demand data. Therefore, in this paper we propose a demand forecasting method based on multi-layer LSTM networks. The proposed method automatically selects the best forecasting model by considering different combinations of LSTM hyperparameters for a given time series using the grid search method. It has the ability to capture nonlinear patterns in time series data, while considering the inherent characteristics of non-stationary time series data. The proposed method is compared with some well-known time series forecasting techniques from both statistical and computational intelligence methods using demand data of a furniture company. These methods include autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), exponential smoothing (ETS), artificial neural network (ANN), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), support vector machines (SVM) and single layer LSTM. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is superior among the tested methods in terms of performance measures.

AB  - A large variety of high-value substation relay protection equipment occupies a considerable amount of inventory space and capital in electric power companies. To improve this problem, this study proposes an inventory prediction model based on the remaining useful life (RUL) of equipment. The model acquires the RUL data of equipment by using the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm, and then, by taking this data as the main factor and the environmental factors and human factors during the operation of equipment as secondary factors, the model can realize the prediction of relay protection equipment in the substation. At the same time, the nature of the enterprise and the requirements for safety inventory are considered. The comparison of calculation results and error analysis, as well as the calculation time, all indicate that the RUL-based inventory forecasting is the best one. This model not only has high prediction accuracy but also has strong stability and portability. The model can provide a strong decision basis for improving the inventory management of the enterprise, enhancing the resource allocation capability, and formulating the spare parts procurement plan under the condition that the spare parts inventory reaches the safety stock.

Abstract: We study spare parts inventory control for an aircraft component repair shop. Inspection of a defective component reveals which spare parts are needed to repair it, and in what quantity. Spare part shortages delay repairs, while aircraft operators demand short component repair times. Current spare parts inventory optimization methods cannot guarantee the performance on the component level, which is desired by the operators. To address this shortfall, our model incorporates operator requirements as time-window fill rate requirements for the repair turnaround times for each component type. In alignment with typical repair shop policies, spare parts are allocated on a first come first served basis to repairs, and their inventory is controlled using (s, S) policies. Our solution approach applies column generation in an integer programming formulation. A novel method is developed to solve the related pricing problem. Paired with efficient rounding procedures, the approach solves real-life instances of the problem, consisting of thousands of spare parts and components, in minutes. A case study at a repair shop reveals how data may be obtained in order to implement the approach as an automated method for decision support. We show that the implementation ensures that inventory decisions are aligned with performance targets.

Abstract: Spare parts are often associated with intermittent demand patterns that render their forecasting a challenging task. Forecasting of spare parts demand has been researched through both parametric and non-parametric approaches. However, little has been contributed in this area from a Bayesian perspective, and most of such research is built around the Poisson demand distributional assumption. However, the Poisson distribution is known to have certain limitations and, further, empirical evidence on the inventory performance of Bayesian methods is lacking. In this paper, we propose a new Bayesian method based on compound Poisson distributions. The proposed method is compared to the Poisson-based Bayesian method with a Gamma prior distribution as well as to a parametric frequentist method and to a non-parametric one. A numerical investigation (on 7400 theoretically generated series) is complemented by an empirical assessment on demand data from about 3000 stock keeping units in the automotive sector to analyse the performance of the four forecasting methods. We find that both Bayesian methods outperform the other methods with a higher inventory efficiency reported for the Poisson Bayesian method with a Gamma prior. This outperformance increases for higher demand variability. From a practical perspective, the outperformance of the proposed method is associated with some added complexity. We also find that the performance of the non-parametric method improves for longer lead-times and higher demand variability when compared to the parametric one.

Abstract: In order to provide high service levels, companies competing in the electronics manufacturing sector need to ensure the availability of spare parts for repair and maintenance operations. This paper examines the purchase life-cycles of electronic spare parts and presents a new way of modeling and forecasting spare part demand for electronic commodities in the spare parts logistics services. The presented modeling methodology is founded on the assumption that the purchase life-cycles of spare parts can be described by a curve with short term fluctuations around it. For this purpose, a flexible Demand Model Function is introduced. The proposed forecasting method uses a knowledge discovery-based approach that is built upon the combined application of analytic and soft computational techniques and is able to indicate the turning points of the purchase life-cycle curve. The novelty lies in the fact that the model function has certain characteristics which support describing and interpreting the demand trend as a function of time. The application of our methodology is mainly advantageous in long-term forecasting, it can be especially useful in supporting purchase planning decisions in the ramp-up and declining phases of purchase life-cycles of product specific spare parts. A demonstrative example is used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed methodology. Its forecasting capability is compared to those of some widely applied methods in business practice. From the results, the new method may be viewed as a viable alternative spare part demand forecasting technique in spare part logistics sector.

Abstract: To address the problem that the demand forecasting methods for repairable airplane spare parts are not advanced, and that the basic forecasting data are not consistent with actual consumption, this paper proposes a double-level combination forecasting approach for repairable spare parts based on relevant data. First, we conduct an analysis for the factors that influence the demand of repairable spare parts. Second, five types of individual direct forecasting models are combined to establish a double-level combination forecast model, which is superior to both individual combination forecasting models and individual direct forecasting models. Finally, we evaluate the forecasting performance by utilizing consumption data for an aircraft fleet and turnover data for an aircraft. The forecasting results provide strong evidence that that the double-level combination forecast model is more accurate and consistent with actual demand.
