    - This can be used to support the importance of having a minimum stock level of spare parts.
3. **On Cost Implications:**
    
    - "These factors have sharply raised the cost of a single machine downtime since the failure of one machine leads to a shutdown or a sharp decrease in the productivity of the entire technological set of machines at the facility."
    - This illustrates the economic consequences of stock-outs, linking back to your discussion on the challenges of balancing stock-outs and overstocking.

- **Role of Demand in MSL Calculation:**
    
    - "We will also refer to Î»j as the demand rate for part j: note that demand for part j is compound Poisson."  
        _This indicates how demand rates are crucial in determining stock levels._
- **Demand Variability and Safety Stock:**
    
    - "Only inspection reveals which parts are needed in each repair. Thus, demand for each spare part is unpredictable, forcing repair shops to keep large spare parts safety stocks."  
        _This highlights the unpredictability of demand and its influence on safety stock._
- **Factors Influencing Demand:**
    
    - "The most challenging of these processes is making sure that the spare parts needed in the component repairs are available when we need them, while at the same time keeping inventory costs under control."

- **On the various factors that influence demand**:  
    "According to the above principles, we mainly consider the following factors: Annual aircraft strength of a fleet, Annual total flight time of a fleet, Annual average flight time of an aircraft, Annual total takeoff-landing times of a fleet, Annual average takeoff-landing times of an aircraft, Annual total spare parts supply good rate of a fleet, Annual average spare parts supply good rate of an aircraft, Annual total spare parts fault number of a fleet, Annual average spare parts fault number of an aircraft, Annual total spare parts consumption number of a fleet, Annual average spare parts consumption number of an aircraft, Annual total spare parts turnover number of a fleet, Annual average spare parts turnover number of an aircraft."
    
- **On calculating consumption and turnover**:  
    "Annual consumption and turnover number of a fleet divided by annual number of aircraft is equivalent to annual consumption and turnover data of an aircraft."

- **Explanation of formulas for calculating MSL and the role of demand variability:**
    - "In fact, in practice the usage context is unlikely to stay the same throughout the lifecycle of a system, which renders the failure rate of a part changing over time."
- **Complexity of forecasting repair demand and its impact on MSL:**
    - "Moreover, the failure rate is often unknown either due to the absence of operational data at the time of initial provisioning, or due to the lack of data when changes in environment occur."
- **Factors influencing demand:**
    - "the demand dataset is composed of many SKUs with a low degree of intermittence since the average demand intervals can be almost equal to 1."
    - "In some cases, the average demand size can be as high as 193 units."
    - "In order to ensure that demand arrival is intermittent, we have considered the values of the parameter Î» in the range 0.05â€“1.95."

    - "...the input at time tit_itiâ€‹, s(ti)s(t_i)s(tiâ€‹) is input into the first LSTM hidden layer along with the h(1)(tiâˆ’1)h(1)(t_{i-1})h(1)(tiâˆ’1â€‹), the output value of the first LSTM block at time point tiâˆ’1t_{i-1}tiâˆ’1â€‹."
- **On Model Evaluation**:
    - "...to evaluate the generated candidate models, performance of each model is assessed using RMSE metric which is calculated based on denormalized input and predicted output data."
- **Overview of RNNs**:
    - "RNNs can model temporal dependencies and are especially suitable for the prediction of sequence data."
- **On LSTM Advantages**:
    - "LSTM can store long-range time dependency information and can suitably map between input and output data."



- **On forecasting strategies**:  
    "There are currently two forecasting strategies for spare parts... One is to forecast directly by individual forecasting methods, which is known as an item-level forecast... The other is to forecast indirectly by combining individual forecasting methods, which is known as a group-level forecast."
    
- **On the innovative approach of the double-level combination forecast**:  
    "A double-level combination forecast model can obtain a superior final result by automatic optimization combination of multiple models, which does not require decision makers to make subjective judgments."
    
- **On neural networks as a forecasting method**:  
    "Of these methods, neural network has a suitable adaptive and self-learning ability and strong anti-interference properties, which is suitable to solve linear and non-linear problems."
    
- **On the limitations of traditional neural networks**:  
    "However, a general neural network has faults such as a slow convergence rate and a high tendency to fall into local minima."
    
- **On genetic algorithms optimizing neural networks**:  
    "To overcome these faults, a genetic algorithm is often used to optimize neural network."
- **On the need for advanced forecasting methodologies**:  
    "It is very important for demand forecasting models to forecast a large number of spare parts precisely, and it is not possible for each spare part to make subjective judgments again to find a superior result after forecasted by different methods."
    
- **On the uniqueness of the proposed methodology**:  
    "In summary, this paper adopts relevant data pre-processed in accordance with actual demand. In addition, a double-level combination forecast model is established using advanced and reliable methods to forecast the demand for repairable spare parts."
    
- **On combining different forecasting methods**:  
    "To solve this problem, different direct forecast methods are often combined to perform forecasts, which can provide distinct useful information."
    
- **On the superiority of combination forecasts**:  
    "It has been demonstrated that combination forecast is superior to direct forecast."
    
- **On the proposed double-level combination forecast approach**:  
    "To further improve the forecasting precision of common combination forecast models, this paper proposes a double-level combination forecast approach to forecast demand."
    
- **On the convergence condition for optimization**:  
    "Set n as the error precision of the objective function. Then the convergence condition is ESSE < n."
    - **Introduction to machine learning for demand forecasting:**
- **Key machine learning techniques used, including neural networks:**
- **Discussion of different neural networks (RNNs, LSTMs) and their application in demand forecasting:**
- **On the Bayesian approach in the context of demand forecasting:**
    - "The Bayesian approach is intuitively appealing when forecasting spare parts demand due to the appropriate assumption of demand distribution parameters changing over time, which reflects the changing failure rates."
- **Advantages of ML over traditional methods, especially in complex, volatile environments:**
    - "the empirical results reveal that SBA and CPB lead to almost the same achieved CSLs, which can be 2% higher than that of WSS."



- **Detailed steps for implementing neural networks in demand forecasting:**
- **Data collection, training models, handling overfitting, and computational challenges:**
    - "Finally, it should be noted that in practice most companies store demand data periodically, which means that data are somehow aggregated over a certain time period..."
    - "The lead-time for all SKUs is less than a month, therefore we assume in the empirical investigation that the lead-time L = 1 month."
    - "It should be noted that, when calculating the order-up-to-level St, the numerical evaluation of the predictive distribution in the CPB method is more computationally demanding than that of SBA."
    - "...numerical integration methods based on analytic approximations or quadrature. However, the computational effort involved would be considerable."
