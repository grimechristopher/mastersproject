        _This indicates how demand rates are crucial in determining stock levels._
- **Demand Variability and Safety Stock:**
    
    - "Only inspection reveals which parts are needed in each repair. Thus, demand for each spare part is unpredictable, forcing repair shops to keep large spare parts safety stocks."

    - "...to evaluate the generated candidate models, performance of each model is assessed using RMSE metric which is calculated based on denormalized input and predicted output data."
- **Overview of RNNs**:
    - "RNNs can model temporal dependencies and are especially suitable for the prediction of sequence data."
- **On LSTM Advantages**:
    - "LSTM can store long-range time dependency information and can suitably map between input and output data."



- **On forecasting strategies**:  
    "There are currently two forecasting strategies for spare parts... One is to forecast directly by individual forecasting methods, which is known as an item-level forecast... The other is to forecast indirectly by combining individual forecasting methods, which is known as a group-level forecast."
    
- **On the innovative approach of the double-level combination forecast**:  
    "A double-level combination forecast model can obtain a superior final result by automatic optimization combination of multiple models, which does not require decision makers to make subjective judgments."
    
- **On neural networks as a forecasting method**:  
    "Of these methods, neural network has a suitable adaptive and self-learning ability and strong anti-interference properties, which is suitable to solve linear and non-linear problems."
    
- **On the limitations of traditional neural networks**:  
    "However, a general neural network has faults such as a slow convergence rate and a high tendency to fall into local minima."
    
- **On genetic algorithms optimizing neural networks**:  
    "To overcome these faults, a genetic algorithm is often used to optimize neural network."
- **On the need for advanced forecasting methodologies**:  
    "It is very important for demand forecasting models to forecast a large number of spare parts precisely, and it is not possible for each spare part to make subjective judgments again to find a superior result after forecasted by different methods."
    
- **On the uniqueness of the proposed methodology**:  
    "In summary, this paper adopts relevant data pre-processed in accordance with actual demand. In addition, a double-level combination forecast model is established using advanced and reliable methods to forecast the demand for repairable spare parts."
    
- **On combining different forecasting methods**:  
    "To solve this problem, different direct forecast methods are often combined to perform forecasts, which can provide distinct useful information."
    
- **On the superiority of combination forecasts**:  
    "It has been demonstrated that combination forecast is superior to direct forecast."
    
- **On the proposed double-level combination forecast approach**:  
    "To further improve the forecasting precision of common combination forecast models, this paper proposes a double-level combination forecast approach to forecast demand."
    
- **On the convergence condition for optimization**:  
    "Set n as the error precision of the objective function. Then the convergence condition is ESSE < n."
    - **Introduction to machine learning for demand forecasting:**
- **Key machine learning techniques used, including neural networks:**
- **Discussion of different neural networks (RNNs, LSTMs) and their application in demand forecasting:**
- **On the Bayesian approach in the context of demand forecasting:**
    - "The Bayesian approach is intuitively appealing when forecasting spare parts demand due to the appropriate assumption of demand distribution parameters changing over time, which reflects the changing failure rates."
- **Advantages of ML over traditional methods, especially in complex, volatile environments:**
    - "the empirical results reveal that SBA and CPB lead to almost the same achieved CSLs, which can be 2% higher than that of WSS."



- **Detailed steps for implementing neural networks in demand forecasting:**
- **Data collection, training models, handling overfitting, and computational challenges:**
    - "Finally, it should be noted that in practice most companies store demand data periodically, which means that data are somehow aggregated over a certain time period..."
    - "The lead-time for all SKUs is less than a month, therefore we assume in the empirical investigation that the lead-time L = 1 month."
    - "It should be noted that, when calculating the order-up-to-level St, the numerical evaluation of the predictive distribution in the CPB method is more computationally demanding than that of SBA."
    - "...numerical integration methods based on analytic approximations or quadrature. However, the computational effort involved would be considerable."
