# Introduction 

Minimum Stock Level (MSL) represents the minimum inventory quantity a company must keep on hand to ensure consistent operations without risking stock-outs or overstocking. Stock-outs occur when stock levels are insufficient to meet demand, leading to disruptions in operation. Overstocking happens when inventory levels exceed demand, increasing storage costs and potential waste. Estimating the MSL requires optimizing the balance between avoiding stock-outs and minimizing overstocking. Achieving this balance prevents operational disruptions and reduces unnecessary costs associated with excess on-hand inventory.

Accurately estimating MSL requires businesses to consider the average usage rate of stock and safety stock. The average usage rate is the quantity of inventory required to meet demand over a specified period. Safety Stock is a buffer to account for fluctuations in demand and supply chain uncertainties. Calculating these variables can be challenging and may vary depending on the nature of the business. Specifically, a manufacturing and repairs company must calculate: customer demand, production materials, and repair materials. These calculations require accurate predictive product and repair demand data to ensure optimal Minimal Stock Levels. 

Traditionally MSL are calcuated using methods that rely on historical data and statistical analysis. These methods rely on using past demand patterns and lead times.
