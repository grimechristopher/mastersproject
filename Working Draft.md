# Modern Methods To Determine Minimum Inventory Levels 

## Introduction 

Minimum Stock Level (MSL) represents the minimum inventory quantity a company must maintain to ensure consistent operations without risking stock-outs or overstocking. Stock-outs occur when stock levels are insufficient to meet demand, leading to disruptions in operation. Overstocking happens when inventory levels exceed demand, increasing storage costs and potential waste. Estimating the MSL requires optimizing the balance between avoiding stock-outs and minimizing overstocking. Achieving this balance prevents operational disruptions and reduces unnecessary costs associated with excess on-hand inventory.

Accurate MSL estimation requires businesses to consider the average usage rate of stock and safety stock. The average usage rate is the quantity of inventory required to meet demand over a specified period. Safety Stock is a buffer to account for fluctuations in demand and supply chain uncertainties. Calculating these variables can be challenging and may vary depending on the nature of the business. Specifically, a manufacturing and repairs company must account for customer demand, production materials, and repair parts. Accurate demand forecasting of demand data is essential to determining the optimal MSL. As noted, “Accurate demand forecasting guarantees suitable supply chain management and enhances customer satisfaction by preventing inventory stock-out.”

Traditionally MSL are calculated using methods that rely on historical data and statistical analysis. such as using past demand patterns, lead times, and necessary service levels. Traditional methods, while reliable, are being replaced with more advanced methods such as using machine learning in order to improve accuracy, especially in complex scenarios. As described by X, "With the development of artificial intelligence, forecasting models based on AI techniques began to play an important role, such as machine learning, deep learning, support vector machine (SVM), backpropagation (BP) neural networks, and long short-term memory (LSTM)." 

Effective demand forecasting is crucial for optimizing inventory management. Accurate forecasting mitigates the risks associated with maintaining appropriate inventory levels. Given the growing complexity of supply chains, leveraging advanced techniques such as machine learning enables businesses to achieve greater adaptability, allowing them to "learn and adjust automatically based on new trends." Improved demand forecasting paves the way for better decision making and resource allocation, driving overall business success.

## Importance Of Demand For Minimum Stock Levels

A basic and standard formula for finding the Minimum Stock Level is: 
$$ Minimum Stock Level = Average Usage Rate * Lead Time + Safety Stock$$
This simple formula can be expanded into a slightly more complex version that highlights demand as a critical variable:
$$ Minimum Stock Level = \frac{Demand}{Time} * Lead Time + Z * \sqrt{Lead Time Variability * Demand Variability}$$
An explanation of the new variables:
- Lead Time Variability - This is the standard Deviation of lead times; for example, every order from vendor ships on a different timeline due to various factors such as supplier reliability, shipping delays, and production schedules. Accurate estimation of lead time variability is necessary for ensuring sufficient stock during the lead time.
- Demand Variability - Demand can also vary throughout lead time due to various influences. Estimating the demand variability assists in planning for changes in demand over the lead time and ensures the company will have sufficient stock during the lead time. 
- Z - The Z-score is the desired confidence level that the company will stay supplied during the lead time. A higher Z-score indicates a higher service level, which is the probability 

Several factors must be considered when determining demand. Demand is the most crucial factor for calculating MSL. Key factors that influence demand include:
- Sales Trends - Trends include general market trends, industry-specific trends, and seasonal trends. 
- Historical Demand Data - Analyzing historical sales data is one way to help identify trends and help forecast future demand.
- Economic Changes - Larger economic conditions, especially in cyclical industries such as airlines, can significantly alter the demand. 
- Special Events - Promotions and anomalies can cause spikes in demand and need to be anticipated. 
- Repair Demand - In industries that handle repairs, it is essential to consider the demand generated by the repair service. Forecasting demand must account for the parts needed for regular sales and the parts required to make repairs. 

Accounting for repair demand significantly complicates demand forecasting and MSL calculations. Repairs require several additional factors that must be considered to determine future demand accurately. For instance, the failure rates of components within each part need to be analyzed to project repair rates and the demand for those parts. Additionally, the time required to ship the broken part to the repair facility, the duration of the repair process itself, and the shipping time for the repaired part back to the customer must all be factored in. These additional variables mean a more comprehensive method for forecasting demand is required. 

Accurately calculating demand is crucial for businesses to optimize inventory levels and avoid stock-outs and overstocking. Demand forecasting is essential in industries with volatile demand, such as manufacturing and aerospace. Traditional demand forecasting methods rely on historical data and statistical models, making them most suitable for more straightforward, predictable, and stable environments. In more complex environments, a more modern approach is necessary. Modern improvements to traditional methods, such as ZIP-METRIC and Poisson-Bayes, attempt to account for complex situations by incorporating dynamic factors into forecasting. While these modern statistical methods are an improvement over traditional methods, machine learning, and neural network approaches have greatly improved demand forecasting. These advanced techniques are effective for complex and highly volatile environments as neural networks can analyze massive datasets and uncover hidden relationships, significantly improving demand forecasting accuracy beyond the capabilities of traditional methods.

## Traditional Methodology

Traditional methods of demand forecasting rely on historical data and statistical models to predict demand. These models are typically designed to work in straightforward and predictable environments. These statistical approaches assume that past trends can predict future demand. They have been widely used and work well in environments where demand follows a consistent and simple pattern. These traditional patterns often fail in industries that experience more dynamic and volatile demand. 

A few examples of the traditional methods are:
- Auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) - ARMA models use historical trends in order to predict future trends using a blend of auto-regressive terms, moving averages, and integration steps. ARMA models are effective at predicting demand in environments where demand follows a consistent cycle.
- Exponential Smoothing - A common technique used to assign decreasing rates to older historical data and valuing newer historical data more. This helps the model react to newer data and trends, assuming those trends are gradual in nature.
- Poisson Processes - A model used commonly in repair shops. The addition of predicting demand changes at random intervals helps with forecasting unusual demand and can be used when the historical data source is too small for other methods. It has been combined with a Bayes approach that significantly improves its accuracy. 
- Inventory Policies - 

These traditional methods are effective in industries that follow clear and predictable trends. Their methodology is not sufficient for industries with volatile demand, especially in industries that experience sudden shifts in trends. There have been numerous improvements to these methods.

Example of modern updates to traditional methods:
- ZIP-METRIC - This method adjusts the traditional statistical models to account for fluctuating demand. It dynamically adjusts metrics in order to allow companies to factor in volatility of demand. 
- Poisson-Bayes Methods - The traditional Poisson process is blended with Bayesian statistics, allowing the model to update predictions as newer data becomes available. This method is useful in industries that are quickly evolving and demand is constantly changing. 

Statistical models provide a foundation for demand forecasting, but often do not succeed in complex or dynamic environments. These methods struggle with the volatile demand patterns that are experienced in aerospace, manufacturing, and repair services. Statistical models are mostly linear and fail to account for dynamic and unpredictable changes in demand. They especially fail in sectors such as aerospace and in repairs, which have irregular and sometimes sparse data. 

As supply chains have grown larger and more complex, traditional methods are becoming more inadequate for accurate demand forecasting. Modern approaches such as machine learning and neural networks provide new ways to predict demand levels. These advanced approaches can processes vast amounts of data and uncover hidden patterns, and adapt to sudden changes, making them an excellent tool in forecasting volatile demand.
