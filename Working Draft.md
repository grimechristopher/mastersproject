# Introduction 

Minimum Stock Level (MSL) represents the minimum inventory quantity a company must maintain to ensure consistent operations without risking stock-outs or overstocking. Stock-outs occur when stock levels are insufficient to meet demand, leading to disruptions in operation. Overstocking happens when inventory levels exceed demand, increasing storage costs and potential waste. Estimating the MSL requires optimizing the balance between avoiding stock-outs and minimizing overstocking. Achieving this balance prevents operational disruptions and reduces unnecessary costs associated with excess on-hand inventory.

Accurate MSL estimation requires businesses to consider the average usage rate of stock and safety stock. The average usage rate is the quantity of inventory required to meet demand over a specified period. Safety Stock is a buffer to account for fluctuations in demand and supply chain uncertainties. Calculating these variables can be challenging and may vary depending on the nature of the business. Specifically, a manufacturing and repairs company must account for customer demand, production materials, and repair parts. Accurate demand forecasting of demand data is essential to determining the optimal MSL. As noted, “Accurate demand forecasting guarantees suitable supply chain management and enhances customer satisfaction by preventing inventory stock-out.”

Traditionally MSL are calculated using methods that rely on historical data and statistical analysis. such as using past demand patterns, lead times, and necessary service levels. Traditional methods, while reliable, are being replaced with more advanced methods such as using machine learning in order to improve accuracy, especially in complex scenarios. As described by X, "With the development of artificial intelligence, forecasting models based on AI techniques began to play an important role, such as machine learning, deep learning, support vector machine (SVM), backpropagation (BP) neural networks, and long short-term memory (LSTM)." 

Effective demand forecasting is crucial for optimizing inventory management. Accurate forecasting mitigates the risks associated with maintaining appropriate inventory levels. Given the growing complexity of supply chains, leveraging advanced techniques such as machine learning enables businesses to achieve greater adaptability, allowing them to "learn and adjust automatically based on new trends." Improved demand forecasting paves the way for better decision making and resource allocation, driving overall business success.

# Importance Of Demand For Minimum Stock Levels

A basic and standard formula for finding the Minimum Stock Level is: 
$$ Minimum Stock Level = Average Usage Rate * Lead Time + Safety Stock$$
This simple formula can be expanded into a slightly more complex version that highlights demand as a critical variable:
$$ Minimum Stock Level = \frac{demand}{time} * Lead Time + Z * \sqrt{Lead Time Variabiliy * Demand Varibility}$$
An explanation of the new variables:
- Lead Time Variability - This is the standard Deviation of lead times. For example, every order from a vendor does not ship on the exact timeline due to various factors such as supplier reliability, shipping delays, and production schedules. Accurate estimation of lead time variability is necessary for ensuring sufficient stock during the lead time.
- Demand Variability - Demand can also vary over the period of lead time due to various influences. Estimation of the demand variability assists in planning for changes in demand over the lead time and ensures the company will not have insufficient stock during the lead time. 
- Z - The Z-score is the desired confidence level that the company will not run out of stock during the lead time. A higher Z-score indicates a higher service level, which is the probability 

There are several factors that must be considered when determining demand. Demand is the most crucial factor for determining MSL. Key factors that influence demand include:
- Sales Trends - Trends include general market trends, industry specific trends, and seasonal trends. 
- Historical Demand Data - Analyzing historical sales data is one way to help identify trends and help forecast future demand.
- Economic Changes - Larger economic conditions, especially in cyclical industries such as airlines, can significantly alter the demand. 
- Special Events - Promotions, and anomalies can cause spikes in demand and need to be anticipated. 
- Repair Demand - In industries that handle repairs, it is essential to consider the demand generated by the repairs service. Forecasting demand must account for the parts needed for regular sales as well as parts needed to make repairs. 

Accounting for repair demand significantly complicates demand forecasting and MSL calculations. Repairs require several additional factors that must be considered to accurately determine future demand. For instance, failure rates of components within each part need to be analyzed to project repair rates and demand for those parts. Additionally, the time for shipping broken part to the repair facility, the duration of the repair process itself, and the shipping time for the repaired part back to the customer must all be factored in. These additional variables mean a more comprehensive method for forecasting demand is required.
