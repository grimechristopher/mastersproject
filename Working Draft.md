# Introduction 

Minimum Stock Level (MSL) represents the minimum inventory quantity a company must maintain to ensure consistent operations without risking stock-outs or overstocking. Stock-outs occur when stock levels are insufficient to meet demand, leading to disruptions in operation. Overstocking happens when inventory levels exceed demand, increasing storage costs and potential waste. Estimating the MSL requires optimizing the balance between avoiding stock-outs and minimizing overstocking. Achieving this balance prevents operational disruptions and reduces unnecessary costs associated with excess on-hand inventory.

Accurate MSL estimation requires businesses to consider the average usage rate of stock and safety stock. The average usage rate is the quantity of inventory required to meet demand over a specified period. Safety Stock is a buffer to account for fluctuations in demand and supply chain uncertainties. Calculating these variables can be challenging and may vary depending on the nature of the business. Specifically, a manufacturing and repairs company must account for customer demand, production materials, and repair parts. Accurate demand forecasting of demand data is essential to determining the optimal MSL. As noted, “Accurate demand forecasting guarantees suitable supply chain management and enhances customer satisfaction by preventing inventory stock-out.”

Traditionally MSL are calculated using methods that rely on historical data and statistical analysis. such as using past demand patterns, lead times, and necessary service levels. Traditional methods, while reliable, are being replaced with more advanced methods such as using machine learning in order to improve accuracy, especially in complex scenarios. As described by X, "With the development of artificial intelligence, forecasting models based on AI techniques began to play an important role, such as machine learning, deep learning, support vector machine (SVM), backpropagation (BP) neural networks, and long short-term memory (LSTM)." 

Effective demand forecasting is crucial for optimizing inventory management. Accurate forecasting mitigates the risks associated with maintaining apporpriate inventory levels. Given the growing complexity of supply chains, leveraging advanced techniques such as machine learning enables businesses to achieve greater adaptability, allowing them to "learn and adjust automatically based on new trends." Improved demand forecasting paves the way for better decision making and resource allocation, driving overall business success.


-- Transition focus to the determination of demand and the processes to do that. specifically spareparts. announce this is for the aerospace indusrty/ commercial airlines

-- Goal Of calculating the MSL. What we do with it.
There is new methods like ZIP-METRIC and other approaches like Machine Learning

- zip- issues with seasonality, changes un supply chain,
- ml - can learn and adjust automatically based on new trends
	- demand forecasting

# Traditional Methodology

A basic and standard formula for finding the Minimum Stock Level is: $$ Minimum Stock Level = Average Usage Rate * Lead Time + Safety Stock$$

discuss traditional methods and the newer methods that have build upon that.
