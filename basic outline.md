### Outline for Survey Paper on Demand Forecasting

#### I. Introduction

- **Definition of Minimum Stock Level (MSL)**
    
    - MSL represents the minimum inventory quantity a company must maintain to avoid stock-outs and overstocking.
    - Discuss the impact of stock-outs on operations and overstocking on costs.
- **Importance of Accurate MSL Estimation**
    
    - Quote: “Accurate demand forecasting guarantees suitable supply chain management and enhances customer satisfaction by preventing inventory stock-out.”
    - Discuss the balance required between stock-out prevention and minimizing overstocking.
    - Highlight the importance of average usage rate and safety stock in estimating MSL.
- **Challenges in MSL Calculation**
    
    - Mention the complexity for manufacturing and repair companies, specifically in the aerospace industry, where demand forecasting for spare parts is critical.
- **Evolution of MSL Calculation Methods**
    
    - Traditional methods rely on historical data and statistical analysis.
    - Introduce modern methods such as ZIP-METRIC and machine learning, noting how they address issues like seasonality and supply chain changes.
    - Transition: "This paper will explore the determination of demand for spare parts in the aerospace industry and the processes involved, including the integration of machine learning for demand forecasting."

#### II. Clear Focus on Demand

- **Core Component of Minimum Stock Levels**
    
    - Discuss the role of accurate demand forecasting in determining optimal MSL.
    - Quote: “Demand for each spare part is unpredictable, forcing repair shops to keep large spare parts safety stocks.”
    - **Explanation**: Highlights the necessity for effective demand forecasting in managing MSL.
- **Challenges in Demand Forecasting**
    
    - Quote: “Current stochastic inventory models do not provide sufficient control over those repair times.”
    - **Explanation**: Addresses the limitations of traditional forecasting models.

#### III. Traditional Methodology

- **Traditional Methods of MSL Calculation**
    
    - Introduce the basic formula for MSL: MinimumStockLevel=AverageUsageRate∗LeadTime+SafetyStock Minimum Stock Level = Average Usage Rate * Lead Time + Safety StockMinimumStockLevel=AverageUsageRate∗LeadTime+SafetyStock
    - Discuss how historical data is used in traditional methods.
- **Limitations of Traditional Methods**
    
    - Quote: “Strict competition among firms in any domain has made it difficult for businesses to accurately forecast customers’ demands using traditional demand forecasting methods.”
    - Explain how these methods can fall short in complex scenarios, particularly in spare parts forecasting.
